##Material Design

Through this app, I learnt more about how google using this design language make an android app different with the common IOS style apps. From an overall view about the material design, the UI presents functional layers of tangible surfaces, with bold but consistant graphic designs and meaningful motions to make the UI immediately comprehensible and delightful.

The material design specs use 8dp grid to align components and suggest some common keylines to use in mobile design, we can use the specs to make the surface layout have a great look whether we are good at the design work.

It's a cheerful experience to transform a boring UI into the material one.
